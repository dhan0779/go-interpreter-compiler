# Go Interpreter/Compiler

After taking CS 4120 - Compilers at Cornell, I decided I wanted to learn how to write an interpreter/compiler by myself again. Its definitely not as complex as the one built in class, but has many of the basic features 
that would be useful. I also really wanted to learn Go for a while, so this helped to hit the ground running. Credit to **Writing an Interpreter in Go** and **Writing a Compiler in Go** by Thorsten Ball as resources.

### Language

The language currently supports the following features:
- integers
- booleans
- strings
- arrays
- hashes
- prefix/infix operators
- conditionals
- bindings
- closures
- functions

To test out the interpreter/compiler, go to their respective folder and run `go run main.go` to start the REPL in the command line. 

Compiler is a work in progress!
